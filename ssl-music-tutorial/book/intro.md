# Self-Supervised Learning for Music Information Retrieval

Welcome to this comprehensive tutorial on Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods applied to Music Information Retrieval (MIR). This tutorial will guide you through the fundamental concepts, practical implementations, and cutting-edge new horizons for SSL.

## What You'll Learn

This tutorial covers:

- **Foundational concepts** of self-supervised learning and their application to music
- **Joint Embedding Architectures (JEA)** including contrastive learning, BYOL, and VICReg
- **Masked modeling** and Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) for music
- **Equivariant SSL** for handling musical transformations like pitch and key changes
- **Generative SSL** approaches that combine representation learning with generation
- **Practical hands-on labs** with real code implementations
- **Evaluation methods** for SSL representations in music tasks
